Purpose: To highlight the wide variety of work I have written at Microsoft and EMC. 

Almost all of my writing samples are available within "Otnes_Writing_Portfolio.pdf." This and the Windows 7 Made Simple PDF are too large to send as email attachments. If you want to view or send samples via email, the other samples in this folder are generally small enough to send in email. 

• Resume - This is subject to frequent change, so email me for the most up to date version.

• Otnes_Writing Portfolio.pdf This is an Adobe Acrobat PDF Portfolio of my writing samples. For best viewing, open in Adobe Acrobat Pro, not Reader. Also on Dropbox:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/tp6doaktjb6q5sg/Kevin%20Otnes%20Writing%20Samples%20Portfolio_No_book.pdf?dl=0. 

• Win_7_Made_Simple.pdf	This is the entire 800 page book I wrote for Apress, “Windows 7 Made Simple.” It is still available on Amazon and other online book sellers. I wrote the proposal, and all content, including text and graphics. This is not a self-published book or vanity press, Apress is a niche publisher for technical computer books. Because of its large file size, some networks may block the download. Also available on Dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/s/k6oir0lyslqnqcm/Windows%207%20Made%20Simple.pdf?dl=0
